# Python-MachineLearning-Project
Hello! This is an example of my Machine Learning project on Python for one of my university classes.

It implies various ML techniques to analyze fund lending data to predict potential defaults and drive decision making.
This project was created for my Northeastern University ML class, it was done in pairs.
All the info was given to us by our professor.

In addition, there is a front-end part that can be launched via Pythonanywhere.com.
File with the front-end part is attached. It was done using Flask.
